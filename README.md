# Personal-Photography-Website

This is the journey of learning and building my personal photography website. There is no detailed project plan for now. But there is few general requirments.

1. Clean and modern looking front page that will keep the viewers eye and make them explore the website.
2. Portfolio page where ill be posting my client stories. This is where i will show case my work and the way i tell the stories so people can decide if im the right person for their project.
3. Pricing page, this is where clinets will be able to see my pricing and info for weddings, elopements and couples loves stories. For everything else they want me to photographe they will be able to see contact me throught the contact page.
4. About page is the page where ill be giving some information about me, my style, for what i look when choosing a client and what they should epect.
5. Contact page where people will be able to contant me without registering.
6. Log in form which will unlock the ability of paid clients to have gallerys with their photos and be able to download them directly from the website.

As it stands right now, Website will be build with HTML, CSS and Python. My knowlage doenst really allow me to connect the front end to the back end yet but ill be update along the way of my journet as a developer. Later on im hoping to involve Django or Flask too.

The goals for the website is to be super clean and modern, fast and reliable. A place where people will not only find out if im the right photographer for them but also enjoy quality photography and story telling. Keep them dreaming and teach them a little bit about visual arts.
